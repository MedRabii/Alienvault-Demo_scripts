Due to the way in which\nApache generates ETag response headers, it may be possible for an\nattacker to obtain sensitive information regarding server files.\nSpecifically, ETag header fields returned to a client contain the\nfile&#039;s inode number.\n\nExploitation of this issue may provide an attacker with information\nthat may be used to launch further attacks against a target network.\n\nOpenBSD has released a patch that addresses this issue. Inode numbers\nreturned from the server are now encoded using a private hash to avoid\nthe release of sensitive information.\n Solution:\n OpenBSD has released a patch to address this issue.\n\nNovell has released TID10090670 to advise users to apply the available\nworkaround of disabling the directive in the configuration file for\nApache releases on NetWare.
